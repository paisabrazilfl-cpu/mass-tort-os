# Overview

This project is a full-stack Mass Tort Operating System (MTOS), a distributed case processing CRM designed for mass tort law firms. It aims to streamline the entire legal process from lead intake and document management to case analysis, compliance, and distributed processing. Key capabilities include AI-driven medical document extraction, advanced validation, robust conflict resolution, a sophisticated form engine for compliant lead generation across numerous tort campaigns, and a comprehensive analytics suite. The core business vision is to provide a scalable, efficient, and compliant solution for managing complex mass tort litigation, significantly improving operational efficiency and compliance for law firms.

# User Preferences

I prefer clear and direct communication. I value a development process that emphasizes iterative development and early feedback. Please ask for my approval before implementing any major architectural changes or significant feature additions. I appreciate detailed explanations for complex technical decisions.

# System Architecture

The project is structured as a pnpm monorepo using TypeScript, targeting Node.js 24. The backend is an Express 5 API, integrated with a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM. API codegen is handled by Orval from an OpenAPI specification. The UI/UX is built with React and Vite.

**Core Architectural Patterns & Design Decisions:**

*   **Monorepo Structure**: Facilitates shared code, consistent tooling, and simplified dependency management.
*   **Distributed Architecture**: Employs a PostgreSQL job queue for asynchronous task processing by a dedicated worker process, enabling scalable and fault-tolerant case analysis and document ingestion.
*   **Deterministic Logic First, AI Second**: Prioritizes deterministic logic for tasks like field validation, scoring, routing, and conflict detection. AI is reserved for natural-language tasks (extraction, summarization, drafting).
*   **File Vault**: Secure storage for case-related documents with SHA-256 hashing for integrity verification.
*   **Conflict Resolution & Error Fallback**: Robust system for detecting conflicts, providing fail-safe modes, and implementing retry logic.
*   **Form Engine**: Comprehensive engine for TCPA and TrustedForm compliant lead generation, including a tort-based form builder, embeddable JS script, live validation, and a multi-step submission pipeline.
*   **Lead Intake Dedup**: Uses `findExistingLeadForIntake` for de-duplicating leads by email and phone per tort, updating existing records with strict fill-empty semantics.
*   **Compliance & Auditability**: Extensive logging of all actions and conflicts to an `audit_log` table, along with compliance-specific fields in lead records.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: JWT (HS256) authentication with role hierarchy and granular route-level access control.
*   **Schema-vs-Database Workflow**: Uses `drizzle-kit push` for schema management.
*   **Web Auth Pipeline**: Manages user authentication, token refresh, MFA, and email verification, with new accounts requiring email verification before sign-in.
*   **Security Infrastructure**: Comprehensive security layer protecting ePHI/PII data, including token revocation, refresh tokens, MFA/TOTP, field-level encryption, rate limiting, and AI threat analysis.
*   **Auto-Document Workflow**: Automates dispatch of e-sign packets and medical record faxes based on lead qualification.
*   **Background Check Hub**: A unified operator action that fans out across nine verification lanes, wrapping existing validators and providing honest status reporting.
*   **Outbound Lead Webhooks**: Dispatches `lead.created` events to configured automation integrations with HMAC-SHA256 signing.
*   **System-Wide Audit Hardening**: Implements structured error responses for Zod validation failures, improved skeleton loading for 404s, pre-flight checks for job queueing, and robust error handling for lead import.
